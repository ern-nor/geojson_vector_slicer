# geojson_vector_slicer

A flutter_map plugin to display fast geojson by slicing into tiles.
Slicing based off https://github.com/mapbox/geojson-vt

## Getting Started

See the example main.dart, will create specific examples later. 

Main feaures:

Display GeoJSON by splitting them into tiles. Includes line simplification as an option.
Polyline/polygon hit detection as well (see example main.dart).
Display Vector tiles (no mapbox styling works on this or is intended to).
Basic tile clustering on markers.
